👋 Hi! I’m Samrood Ali, a Software Development Engineer (SDE II) at Peoplegrove, specializing in building and scaling web applications. 

My journey includes completing an intensive coding bootcamp, working at an early-stage product-based startup, and now contributing to PeopleGrove, an education networking platform similar to LinkedIn. I collaborate with teams to build features from scratch, maintain existing ones, and tackle the challenges of managing a large-scale user base of more than 20 million users.

I’m passionate about continuous learning and is always learning and keeping myself up-to date. 

Additionally, I'm writing a series about web security on Medium, with links available on my website, samroodali.com

> 🧠 Currently learning by doing [Codecrafters challenges](https://app.codecrafters.io/users/SamroodAli) — building tools such as Redis, Git, and HTTP servers from scratch.
